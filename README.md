# FTSim-robot3D
A 3D robot hand simulated in Unity that can communicate with a PLC over a Modbus protocol. The simulator FTSim (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8514259) 
was developed for the use in the course of Process automation. In the scope of my bachelor's thesis I enabled the communication with a PLC over Modbus protocol, 
using an open source library EasyModbus.
